                <h3>Kidney</h3>
                <p>The kidneys' job is to filter your blood. They remove wastes, control the body's fluid balance, and keep the right levels of electrolytes. All of the blood in your body passes through them about 40 times a day.</p>

                <h3>liver</h3>
                <p>The liver has two large sections, called the right and the left lobes. The gallbladder sits under the liver, along with parts of the pancreas and intestines. The liver and these organs work together to digest, absorb, and process food.</p>

                                  <p> <span> function panel:</span> A liver function panel checks how well the liver is working and consists of many different blood tests.
                                    <span>ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase):</span> An elevated ALT helps identify liver disease or damage from any number of causes, including hepatitis
                                    <span>(Aspartate Aminotransferase):</span>  Along with an elevated ALT, the AST checks for liver damage.
                                    <span>Alkaline phosphatase:</span> Alkaline phosphatase is present in bile-secreting cells in the liver; it's also in bones. High levels often mean bile flow out of the liver is blocked.
                                    <span>Bilirubin:</span> High bilirubin levels suggest a problem with the liver.
                                    <span>albumin</span> As part of total protein levels, albumin helps determine how well the liver is working. 
                                    <span>Ammonia: </span>Ammonia levels in the blood rise when the liver is not functioning properly.
                                    <span>Hepatitis A tests:</span> If hepatitis A is suspected, the doctor will test liver function as well as antibodies to detect the hepatitis A virus.
                                    <span>Hepatitis B tests:</span> Your doctor can test antibody levels to determine if you have been infected with the hepatitis B virus
                                    <span>Hepatitis C tests:</span> In addition to checking liver function, blood tests can determine if you have been infected with the hepatitis C virus.
                                   <span>Prothrombin Time (PT):</span> A prothrombin time, or PT, is commonly done to see if someone is taking the correct dose of the blood thinner warfarin (Coumadin). It also checks for blood clotting problems.
                                    <span>Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT):</span> A PTT is done to check for blood clotting problems</p>

                                <h4>Kidney Tests</h4>
                                <p>  <span>Urinalysis: </span> A routine test of the urine by a machine and often by a person looking through a microscope. Urinalysis can help detect infections, inflammation, microscopic bleeding, and kidney damage.
                                  <span>Kidney ultrasound: </span> A probe placed on the skin reflects sound waves off the kidneys, creating images on a screen. Ultrasound can reveal blockages in urine flow, stones, cysts, or suspicious masses in the kidneys
                               <span>Computed tomography (CT) scan:</span>A CT scanner takes a series of X-rays, and a computer creates detailed images of the kidneys.
                                  <span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan:</span> A scanner uses radio waves in a magnetic field to make high-resolution images of the kidneys. 
                                  <span>Urine and blood cultures:</span> If an infection is suspected, cultures of the blood and urine may identify the bacteria responsible. This can help target antibiotic therapy.
                                  <span>Ureteroscopy:</span> An endoscope (flexible tube with a camera on its end) is passed through the urethra into the bladder and ureters. Ureteroscopy generally cannot reach the kidneys themselves, but can help treat conditions that also affect the ureters.
                                  <span>Kidney biopsy: </span> Using a needle inserted into the back, a small piece of kidney tissue is removed. Examining the kidney tissue under a microscope may help diagnose a kidney problem.

                          <p>
                         <span>Antibiotics:</span> Kidney infections caused by bacteria are treated with antibiotics. Often, cultures of the blood or urine can help guide the choice of antibiotic therapy.
                            <span>Nephrostomy:</span> A tube (catheter) is placed through the skin into the kidney. Urine then drains directly from the kidney, bypassing any blockages in urine flow.
                           <span>Lithotripsy:</span>  Some kidney stones may be shattered into small pieces that can pass in the urine. Most often, lithotripsy is done by a machine that projects ultrasound shock waves through the body.
                            <span>Nephrectomy:</span> Surgery to remove a kidney. Nephrectomy is performed for kidney cancer or severe kidney damage.
                           <span>Dialysis: </span> Artificial filtering of the blood to replace the work that damaged kidneys can't do. Hemodialysis is the most common method of dialysis in the U.S.
                           <span>Hemodialysis:</span> A person with complete kidney failure is connected to a dialysis machine, which filters the blood and returns it to the body. Hemodialysis is typically done 3 days per week in people with ESRD.
                           <span>Peritoneal dialysis: </span> Placing large amounts of a special fluid in the abdomen through a catheter allows the body to filter the blood using the natural membrane lining the abdomen. After a while, the fluid with the waste is drained and discarded.
                            <span>Kidney transplant:</span> Transplanting a kidney into a person with ESRD can restore kidney function. A kidney may be transplanted from a living donor, or from a recently deceased organ donor.</p>

                                <span>Hepatitis A treatment:</span> Hepatitis A usually goes away with time.
                               <span> Hepatitis B treatment: </span>Chronic hepatitis B often requires treatment with antiviral medication.
                                <span>Hepatitis C treatment:</span> Treatment for hepatitis C depends on several factors.
                                <span>Liver transplant:</span> A liver transplant is needed when the liver no longer functions adequately, whatever the cause.
                                <span>Liver cancer treatment:</span> While liver cancer is usually difficult to cure, treatment consists of chemotherapy and radiation. In some cases, surgical resection or liver transplantation is performed.
                                <span>Paracentesis:</span> When severe ascites -- swelling in the belly from liver failure -- causes discomfort, a needle can be inserted through the skin to drain fluid from the abdomen.
                                <span>ERCP (Endocscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography):</span> Using a long, flexible tube with a camera and tools on the end, doctors can diagnose and even treat some liver problems. </p>
